introduction: Learn how to store data and files in serverless PHP applications running on AWS Lambda.

The filesystem on AWS Lambda **is read-only**, except for the `/tmp` directory.

On top of that, the filesystem is not shared between instances of a lambda when it scales up. For example a file `/tmp/foo.json` will not be shared across instances of the same lambda. Since a lambda can scale up or down at any time, data in the `/tmp` directory can be lost.

## Application data

Application data must not be stored in `/tmp` because of the behavior described above.

Instead data can be stored in [databases](/docs/environment/database.md) or in storage services like AWS S3.

## Application cache

Performance-wise, using AWS S3 for storing the application cache is not ideal.

The following solutions can be used instead:

- pre-generate the cache in the project directory before deploying
- store the cache into the `/tmp` directory
- store the cache into a distributed cache service like Memcache or Redis

### Pre-generating the cache

Some frameworks allow to pre-generate some caches. For example in Symfony the container can be compiled via `bin/console cache:warmup`, or in Laravel the config cache can be generated before deploying.

When possible **this is the best solution**: no generation will occur in production, and reading from the filesystem will be fast.

### Store in the `/tmp` directory

Some framework or library caches must be written into files. In that case storing in the `/tmp` directory is a good solution.

Remember that anything stored in `/tmp` will be lost when a lambda stops. When a lambda starts, the `/tmp` directory will be empty so the cache will be generated again.

Note that this is useful for deployments: no need to clear caches on deployments since a new version of the lambda will run on new instances (with an empty `/tmp` directory).

This solution is ideal when the cached data is fast to generate and never changes (e.g. template caching, framework caches).

### Store in a distributed cache service

Using a distributed cache service has the following advantages:

- the cache is not lost when the lambda scales down
- the cache is not lost when deploying
- the cache is shared between all lambda instances

The disadvantage is that if data format changes between deployments then a deployment strategy must be used to either clear the cache and regenerate it, or separate the cache between application versions.

Cache services that can be used include for example Redis or Memcache. AWS offers those as managed services through AWS Elasticache.

This solution is ideal for cache data that can change during the life of the application (e.g. caching a website menu, an API response).
